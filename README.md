# Machine Learning Model README
Overview \
This repository contains a machine learning model for image classification using the ResNet50 architecture. The ResNet50 model is a deep convolutional neural network renowned for its performance in image recognition tasks.

Model Details \
ResNet50 Description: ResNet50 is a variant of the ResNet model (Residual Network) that consists of 50 layers. It utilizes skip connections (or shortcuts) to address the vanishing gradient problem and enables training of very deep neural networks effectively. \
Usage: This model is pretrained on large image datasets like ImageNet and can be fine-tuned for specific classification tasks or used as a feature extractor.
